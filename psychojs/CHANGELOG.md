# PsychoJS Change Log
All notable changes to the latest, unreleased version of the PsychoJS library and to the previously released versions are documented here.

Please note that released versions of the library are not set in stone: we will keep fixing important issues and adding minor features beyond the library release dates. Those changes will be documented in this document.
